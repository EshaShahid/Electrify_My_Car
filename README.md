# Electrify My Car ðŸ”ŒðŸš—

**Electrify My Car** is an informational and comparison-based application designed to guide motorists considering the switch to electric vehicles (EVs). It provides insights into the cost of charging, electric vehicle range, pricing, charging station locations, and comparison scenarios between conventional and electric cars.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

With the rising interest in electric vehicles, this application aims to simplify decision-making by offering clear, research-backed data on:
- Charging costs and station availability
- Car pricing and range comparisons
- Environmental and economic benefits
- Real-world scenarios: switching from fuel to electric

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- EV vs. conventional car comparisons
- Cost calculators for charging and ownership
- Charging point locator
- Interactive visual guides

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Figma** â€“ For UI/UX design and prototyping  
- **HTML/CSS/JS** â€“ For frontend development  
- **Flask** â€“ For backend integration (future plan)  
- **GitHub** â€“ For collaboration and version control

## ðŸ§  Roles & Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort.  
**My role included:**
- Conducting background research on EV adoption and charging infrastructure  
- Designing 2â€“3 pages in the interactive prototype  
- Contributing to the structure and user journey of the application
